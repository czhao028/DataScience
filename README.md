# Predicting the Next COVID-19 Hotspot

## Motivation
This goal is ambitious: like predicting the stock market, coronavirus outbreak predictions can be a tricky thing. An unaccounted variable can come into play: someone with coronavirus decided to have a birthday party, and the virus spreads like wildfire. Nonetheless, after reading [a few opinions by experts](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-how-bad-it-gets-different-communities/), there are a few factors that we can identify that make a city more vulnerable than others. Our project seeks to identify which of those factors are most powerful in predicting an outbreak and the probability that Houston as vulnerable or likely to a massive coronavirus spread.

## Methodology
After individually going through [current hotspots](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/map-reveals-hidden-u-s-hotspots-of-coronavirus-infection/) as defined by cases per 10,000 people (including rural areas that often get overlooked), we listed out the major reasons that coronavirus was brought to regions & what worsened the problem in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aYphRfF8b_siem5ZNdMKAaTm5iFiyQtQwD_adOMns5U/edit?usp=sharing). By examining expert opinions & narrowing down into the most recurring causes, we chose 6 factors to investigate the importance of:
<ol>
  <li> Travel
    <ul>
      <li> The majority of cases were brought to coasts and small towns by international or out-of-state travel
    </ul>
   <li> Population Density
     <ul>
      <li> "Density is a factor in this pandemic, as it has been in previous ones. The very same clustering of people that makes our great cities more innovative and productive also makes them, and us, vulnerable to infectious disease."
