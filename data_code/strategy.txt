Strategy for the Airport files:
- Combine MSA Hotspots with MSA-County Data
    - df[df['MSA'].isin(list_of_MSA's)]
    - Left with counties in MSA hotspots
- Iterate through each of those counties, build connections, and add to their disease score
    - Set the value of the hotspots' disease score to be +inf
- After, iterate through key,val in airport_code_to_county dictionary,
  and add their disease scores to a DataFrame
- Outer-join with ALL COUNTIES IN US; df.fillna(0) to assign a disease score of 0 to all untouched counties
